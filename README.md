This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Development Workflow
## Merge Requests

    Merge requests must be accepted by another team member.
    Branches cannot be deleted until the merge is complete.
    Branches should be deleted after merging, except for the develop branch.

## Code of Conduct

    Collaboration: Merge requests should be reviewed and approved by another team member if code was not pair-programmed.
    Review Deadlines: Soft deadline for reviewing merge requests is 3 days. Automatic reminders can be set up.
    Issue Tracking: All tasks should be added to the issue board and broken down into smaller tasks.
    Communication: Raise any issues or irritations as soon as possible to prevent escalation.
    Code Review: Thoroughly check the work before accepting it and document how it was checked.
    Testing: All code merge requests must include testing.
    Test Coverage: Agree on a minimum test coverage of 50% for core functionality.
    SOLID Principles: Follow SOLID principles in the codebase.
    Weekly Meetings: Meetings will be held every Tuesday as a baseline.

## Kanban Workflow

    Work in Progress (WIP): Maintain a maximum number of WIP items.
    Structure:
        Ideas
        Issues
        In Progress (Tests)
        In Progress (Code/Production)
        In Review
        Done

# Additional Notes

    Ensure that the database schema is designed to efficiently handle the volume of data expected.
